Open 3D Model Viewer 
========

A platform-independent general-purpose 3D model viewer (a modernized replacement for the former AssimpView).

This is _work in progress_. As soon as the first version is ready, I'll add a website and provide download packages.
I currently intend to support Windows, Linux and Ma (the latter through Mono!).
