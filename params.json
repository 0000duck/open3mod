Technically,\r\nopen3mod is based on the [Open Asset Import Library] (https://github.com/assimp/assimp).\r\n\r\n__Some key points:__\r\n\r\n\r\n - Supports a huge variety (30+) of 3D file formats (incl. __FBX, DXF, Collada, Obj, 3DS, STL, IFC__). \r\n - Efficient tools to inspect the scene (or parts of it - filtering should be as easy as possible because\r\n   this is a frequent use-case). \r\n - Tabbed UI, so many files can be open at once. \r\n - Multiple viewports (up to 4) and different camera modi, such as orbit cameras or even First-Person-View.\r\n - Virtually all texture file formats are supported through DevIL. Textures are being loaded asynchronously, so there\r\n   are no extra waiting times if you only care about geometry.\r\n - Export of scenes (or parts of scenes) is supported, too. Output formats include Collada, 3DS, PLY, STL, OBJ \r\n   (as of now).\r\n\r\nThis is _work in progress_. As soon as the first version is ready, I'll add a website and provide download packages.\r\nI currently intend to support Windows, Linux and Mac (the two latter through Mono!).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
