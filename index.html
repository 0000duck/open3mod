          <h1>Open 3D Model Viewer </h1>

<p>A platform-independent general-purpose 3D model viewer and a modernized replacement for the former AssimpView. Technically,
open3mod is based on the <a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">Open Asset Import Library</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Some key points:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Supports a huge variety (30+) of 3D file formats (incl. <strong>FBX, DXF, Collada, Obj, 3DS, STL, IFC</strong>). </li>
<li>Efficient tools to inspect the scene (or parts of it - filtering should be as easy as possible because
this is a frequent use-case). </li>
<li>Tabbed UI, so many files can be open at once. </li>
<li>Multiple viewports (up to 4) and different camera modi, such as orbit cameras or even First-Person-View.</li>
<li>Virtually all texture file formats are supported through DevIL. Textures are being loaded asynchronously, so there
are no extra waiting times if you only care about geometry.</li>
<li>Export of scenes (or parts of scenes) is supported, too. Output formats include Collada, 3DS, PLY, STL, OBJ 
(as of now).</li>
</ul><p>This is <em>work in progress</em>. As soon as the first version is ready, I'll add a website and provide download packages.
I currently intend to support Windows, Linux and Mac (the two latter through Mono!).</p>
